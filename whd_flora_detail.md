# Flowers of Wollaton Hall Drive

This is a listing of all higher plants I have seen on Wollaton Hall Drive since about 2004. The area includes St Mary's Churchyard, the roadway, verges and grassy areas adjacent to Middleton Boulevard, garden walls (including the garden face), the nearer grounds of Lenton Lodge, the bit of Derby Road bank which faces on to WHD.

A quick idea of locations is given by code-letters for the main ones:

* **G**: found in gardens (this is mainly an indication of eihter ubqiquity or likelihood of something being a garden escape)
* **C**: the churchyard
* **V**: verges
* **U**: urban commons, here the two larger stretches of grass at the Middleton Boulevard end
* **R**: growing on root plates of Beech trees (or their stumps)
* **L**: grounds of Lenton Lodge
* **D**: Derby Road banks
* **P**: road gutters, pavement cracks, foot of garden walls etc (basically the annual weed flora)

## Ferns (5)
* Bracken G An exception to the rule as this is present only in a garden. A patch of Bracken can be seen close to the gate of Middleton House. This is of interest because Bracken would have probably been a major component of the natural vegetation here (akin to the roughs in Wollaton Park Golf Course)
